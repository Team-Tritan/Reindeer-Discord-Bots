# Reindeer Discord Bots for Christmas!

## About The Project:
It's almost that time of the year again! To keep up last year's fun, I've decided to bring back the Reindeer Bots so everyone's server can be just a little bit more merry! This bot will sit in a voice channel named 'Reindeer Pin' to show some spirit in your server.


## Info:
- `[Mention] help` pulls up a info menu.
- `[Mention]` gives the reindeer a carrot.


## Instructions:

1. Install discord.js v12.5.1.
2. Make a bot application in the Discord developer portal for every reindeer, yes, every one.
3. Add all tokens to the config file array.
4. Create a voice channel named 'Reindeer Pen'.
5. Invite all the reindeer bots to your server.
6. Send a message in any channel to have the reindeer join their channel and let them sit pretty! Ping them to give them a carrot! :p
